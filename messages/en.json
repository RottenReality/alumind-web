        "description": "The ARTUS 8 meets the requirement of providing fast, precise, and accurate analysis for a perfect melt. It is one of the most powerful and reliable spectrometers, offering a complete range of analytical programs, including cast irons, carbon and nitrogen in steels, and all alloying elements and their traces needed for treatment. It offers all the advantages of a flexible and versatile Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) spectrometer. It even competes in certain applications with classic Photo Multiplier Tube systems, which are still the benchmark in high-end Optical Emission Spectrometry (OES)."

        "description": "The ARTUS 10 includes a scientific-grade CMOS sensor that reduces analysis time for some metals to as little as 10 seconds. Furthermore, its smart algorithms eliminate background interference, allowing for optimal analytical performance. Among the features of the ARTUS are also included: a dual optical system; a flowing gas channel design; a cast aluminum encapsulated light chamber; tool-less access to the UV and visible optical lenses; and a latch-type electrode locking device."
